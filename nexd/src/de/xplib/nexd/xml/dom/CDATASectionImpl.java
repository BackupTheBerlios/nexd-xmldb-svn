     * Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy 
     * constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent; (
     * <code>parentNode</code> is <code>null</code>.) and no user data. User 
     * data associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if 
     * any <code>UserDataHandlers</code> has been specified along with the 
     * associated data these handlers will be called with the appropriate 
     * parameters before this method returns.
     * <br>Cloning an <code>Element</code> copies all attributes and their 
     * values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent 
     * defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any children it 
     * contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text contained in 
     * an the <code>Element</code> since the text is contained in a child 
     * <code>Text</code> node. Cloning an <code>Attribute</code> directly, 
     * as opposed to be cloned as part of an <code>Element</code> cloning 
     * operation, returns a specified attribute (<code>specified</code> is 
     * <code>true</code>). Cloning an <code>Attribute</code> always clones 
     * its children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this 
     * is a deep clone or not. Cloning an <code>EntityReference</code> 
     * automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding 
     * <code>Entity</code> is available, no matter whether this is a deep 
     * clone or not. Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of 
     * this node.
     * <br>Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy, 
     * but the children of an <code>EntityReference</code> clone are readonly
     * . In addition, clones of unspecified <code>Attr</code> nodes are 
     * specified. And, cloning <code>Document</code>, 
     * <code>DocumentType</code>, <code>Entity</code>, and 
     * <code>Notation</code> nodes is implementation dependent.
     * 
     * @param deep If <code>true</code>, recursively clone the subtree under 
     *   the specified node; if <code>false</code>, clone only the node 
     *   itself (and its attributes, if it is an <code>Element</code>).
     * @return The duplicate node.
